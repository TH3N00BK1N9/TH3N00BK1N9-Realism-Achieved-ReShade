# TH3N00BK1N9's-Realism-Achieved-ReShade
Wanted to add ray tracing to almost any game of your choosing? Well, now you can with this FREE universal ReShade preset!
---------------------------------------------------------------
Before we begin:
I strongly recommend that you use this preset with games that do not max out your GPU since it will crash your game. IF you do want to use it then turn some graphics settings down so avoid any issues.

Some game weirdly crash for example Red Dead Redeption 2 will crash when I pause the game or open the map with this shader on, I don't know why it just does, so be sure to toggle the effects off when opening menus. 

Remember, this is ReShade and so it only takes into account depth input so do not expect a massive change as it still uses the game's lighting to add appropriate global illumination and ambiant occlusion. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Update Log:
1. Updated all effects
2. Removed HDR effect (made images too dark and addeed too much contrast)
3. SSRTGI no longer glows (or no obvious glow) around smaller objects
4. Renamed to "TH3N00BK1N9's Realism Achieved ReShade"
5. Fixed inaccurate Global Illumination

How to install:

Video tutorial here: https://youtu.be/ir9Say-e0z0?si=Bt2mneDfHYxgM7r0

1. Download the files from this GitHub page and extract the .zip file.
2. Simply install ReShade to the game of your choice.
3. When prompted by the ReShade installer, browse TH3N00BK1N9_SSRTGI.ini (if you downloaded it and left it there, it should be in your downloads folder).
4. Continue with installation as normal.
5. DONE! You have successfully installed SSRTGI to your game.
You may need to adjust display depth, there are many tutorais online, (when I have the time, I will provide one soon!) in the addons tab there should be a way to support DLSS, FSR, XeSS or any other upscaler.
